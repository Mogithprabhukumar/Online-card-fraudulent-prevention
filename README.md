# Online-card-fraudulent-prevention
E-commerce's growth brings convenience and increased cybercrime. Organizations use advanced security measures to protect customer data and prevent unauthorized access. However, limited customer-focused measures leave consumers vulnerable to threats like credit card fraud and identity theft. Ensuring secure online transactions is a key research focus. Security features such as Honeypot CAPTCHA distinguish humans from bots, AES encryption protects data during transmission, MFA adds verification layers, RSA encryption secures transactions with asymmetric keys, and the Luhn algorithm validates credit card numbers and detects data entry errors. These measures boost e-commerce security without compromising user experience.
